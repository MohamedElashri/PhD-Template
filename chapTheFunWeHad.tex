\label{chap:TheFunWeHad}

I'm not saying what comes before isn't unhelpful, but if you want some more sensible instructions go and look up Andy's example which is at \href{https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hepthesis}{https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hepthesis}.
I really just wanted to make a very minimal and working version of Andy's example which compiled without having to generate the bibliography using anything fancier than bibtex.

To compile this stuff you can do:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{My algorithm for success}\label{euclid}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{MyProcedure}{}
\State pdflatex thesis.tex
\State bibtex thesis.aux
\State pdflatex thesis.tex
\State pdflatex thesis.tex
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Note, these are commands that work for me on my linux machine using \texttt{pdflatex} and \texttt{bibtex}. I don't care about you. They may not work for you. Also, to use this horible algorithm format I had to add two usepackage statements (\texttt{algorithm}, \texttt{algpseudocode}) to the preamble.tex file. It wasn't worth it..
