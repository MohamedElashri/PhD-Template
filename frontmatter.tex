%% Declaration
\begin{declaration}
  This dissertation is the result of my own work, except where explicit
  reference is made to the work of others, and has not been submitted
  for another qualification to this or any other university. This
  dissertation does not exceed the word limit for the respective Degree
  Committee. I hope that I will pass without revision that will ruin another couple of months from my life.

%% Preface
\begin{preface}
  This thesis describes my greatest work yet. You know it will be good. I have double the consciousness of most people \cite{ciccariello2009critique} and so I assume this will be hard for most people to understand, but you can do it. Peace. 

  \noindent
  How about you look at some of \ChapterRef{chap:TheFunWeHad} for a better idea of what is going on.
